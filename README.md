# 🧮 Web-Based Calculator
This is a web-based calculator application built using Django for the backend and HTML/CSS for the frontend. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users enter numbers and choose an operation through a simple web form. The input is processed by the Django backend, which calculates the result and displays it on the webpage. This project demonstrates the integration of frontend and backend technologies and basic web application development using Python and Django.
